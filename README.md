Page 2: The second page provides information about the vehicle's climate settings and allows users to adjust temperature and fan speed.

#Installation
To run the Tesla Mobile App Clone locally on your development environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]
Install the dependencies: npm install or yarn install
Start the development server: expo start
Run the app on an emulator/simulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.
Usage
The Tesla Mobile App Clone is built using React Native and Expo, utilizing the Expo Router library for basic navigation. The app follows a simple navigation flow:

The home screen is rendered upon launching the app, displaying general vehicle information.
